Got it, let me summarize the key steps you took in this project:

## Environment Setup
- You utilized various machine learning and data analysis libraries to build your model.

## Data Loading and Exploration
- You loaded the customer churn data for the telecommunications company.
- You explored and analyzed the data to understand its structure and characteristics.

## Data Preprocessing
- You preprocessed the data by converting non-numerical features into numerical formats that can be used for model training.

## Model Building
- You defined the objective of the project, which is to predict customer churn for the telecommunications company.
- You split the data into training and validation sets.
- You chose to use the KNeighborsRegressor model from the scikit-learn library to build your predictive model.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- You trained the KNeighborsRegressor model using the prepared training data.
- You evaluated the model's performance on the validation data and achieved an accuracy of 87%.
